# MongoScraper

As fears around the coronavirus spread across the global economy, the U.S. stock market has responded with worrying volatility. Whether you follow the market closely or not, the uncertainty of it all raises many questions. Are we heading into a recession? How will this impact the average worker? And above all, when will it get better? Your greatest tactic for navigating this volatile market is to stay informed... MongoScraper will help you do just that!

MongoScraper is a full-stack ReactJS web application that uses NPM packages axios and cheerio to scrape the Wall Street Journal website, allowing users to view a summary of the latest WSJ articles with a link to read the article in full. After registering an account, users can save articles to their profile page that they can access at anytime. Users can then manage their articles in a variety of ways - by adding or deleting any notes to specific articles as well as deleting any articles they no longer need.
